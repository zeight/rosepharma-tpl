							<h2>HYALURONIC ACID</h2>

						<h2>Hyaluronic Acid</h2>
						<p>The application of synthetic hyaluronic acid is an effective, gentle and minimally invasive treatment: very small drops are placed
under the skin and distributed along the ideal lines of the face, to give a sculpting effect of the contours and a targeted increase in
volume.

The tissues in the injection area are lifted and plumped, restoring an aesthetically appreciable tension to the general appearance
of the surrounding areas.

To obtain a natural and elegant result, while minimizing the patient’s discomfort, the research has developed very thin and flexible
needles, almost imperceptible to most people.

Zhoabex has developed several injectable hyaluronic acid formulas, so that they can be adapted to different uses, and the range
of products is continuously expanded: from fillers for replacing natural hyaluronic acid, up to fillers dedicated to treatments of
more structural type.

Lip fillers, for example, are formulated to keep the tissue soft but plumped, while the cheekbone lift has a formula suitable for
stronger solidity and resistance, and so on for the many treatments required.

In this field it is essential to be a well informed and demanding customer and ask for a doctor with superior training, expert in facial
anatomy and aesthetic medicine, sensitive to uor requests and with proven experience in the choice and use of the most suitable
fillers.</p>
