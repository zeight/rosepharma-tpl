						<h2 class="lowercase">What happens to my skin as I age?</h2>
						<p>Ageing is a natural process that aff ects everyone. Its signs
vary according to age, skin type, lifestyle and hereditary
factors.
The skin, as it ages, undergoes an extremely gradual
process that begins around 25-30 years.
The signs of ageing include loss of elasticity, less fi rm
skin, folds, wrinkles and blemishes on the skin, along with
a less shiny appearance.
There are 2 main types of ageing factors to consider:
• Intrinsic or chronological skin ageing: it depends on
genetic factors
• Extrinsic skin ageing: it depends on environmental
factors
While extrinsic ageing factors can be well controlled with
the daily care of our skin and our habits, Intrinsic factors
are are unique and inevitable, but they can be eff ectively
countered with specifi c treatments..</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box col-6 content">
						<h2 class="lowercase">What are wrinkles?</h2>
						<p>Wrinkles are the most common and visible eff ect of
skin aging and a sign of the physiological decrease of
collagen and hyaluronic acid in the skin.
They are common because they result from the inevitable
loss of elasticity of the dermal layers, and are visible
because they fi rst appear in areas exposed to the extrinsic
factors of aging.
The sun is one of the most crucial factors, and this leads
to wrinkles to appear fi rst in areas exposed to UV rays,
typically the face, neck, hands.
Wrinkles appear on the skin as lasting lines and folds
and appear fi rst in the areas most subject to repeated
movements, such as the outer sides of the eyes and
glabella, the lips contour, the nasolabial line.</p>

							<h2 class="lowercase">What is HA?</h2>
							<p>Hyaluronic acid, or HA, is a natural substance produced
by our body, and manly present in the skin, the eyes and
connective tissue. Its importance comes from its ability
to hold water. Thanks to this ability it can give elasticity,
structure and resistance to tissues.
When our body, as we age, begins to synthesize less
hyaluronic acid, the eff ect is especially visible on the
skin, and particularly in areas exposed to the sun. We
experience loss of smoothness and compactness.
Nowadays it is possible to synthesize hyaluronic acid
starting from plant ingredients and obtain this precious,
safe and eff ective ingredient. Hyaluronic acid is used
to develop innovative treatments for every skin need:
add volume, smooth lines, defi ne contour, improve the
appearance of the skin.</p>

							<h2 class="lowercase">What is a filler?</h2>
							<p>A dermal filler is a HA based medical device which is
injected under the skin through a syringe in order to
restore volumes and smooth lines.
The diff erent formulations based on hyaluronic acid adapt
to the diff erent needs of each individual.
The more viscous combinations help sculpt with greater
defi nition where the lack of tissue is most important.
The less viscous formulas adapt to the shape of the face
to give volume with an extremely natural eff ect.
Additionally, hyaluronic acid can also be specially
developed to improve hydration in the treated areas.</p>

						<h2 class="lowercase">How long does
the treatment take?</h2>
						<p>The duration of the treatment depends on the individual
need and on the purpose of the fi ller you are using.
Larger areas take longer, while smaller treatments are
performed more quickly.
The treatment is performed with professional tools that
minimize unpleasant sensations and allow maximum
precision in application, so that the duration of the
treatment is always as short as possible.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box col-6 content">
						<h2 class="lowercase">Is it painful?</h2>
						<p>Pain perception varies from person to person.
While some may experience a mild discomfort, for others
the treatment is almost imperceptible.
In any case the advanced technologies allow to adapt the
treatment to the sensitivity of each one.
The syringes and needles themselves signifi cantly reduce
the mild pain that can be felt by the most sensitive
patients, providing the best comfortable treatment.</p>

							<h2 class="lowercase">Which filler
should I use?</h2>
							<p>Hyaluronic acid-based dermal fi llers have a common
matrix but have diff erent characteristics and can be
categorized mainly for the diff erent degree of cohesivity,
which can be described as the density of the product.
Each specifi c composition has a diff erent eff ect on the
skin and gives a specifi c result, also in relation to the
treated area.
Your particular needs must be evaluated together with a
professional specialized in aesthetic medicine, who can
evaluate the unique characteristics of each patient and
show you the best options for your wishes.</p>

						<h2 class="lowercase">What benefi ts could I
see in my skin aft er the
treatment?</h2>
						<p>You will immediately notice smoother skin and a fi rmer,
smoother appearance in the treated areas.
The addition of volume lifts expression and improves
facial contour and symmetry.
The professional treatment gives harmony to the shape
and helps to relax even the surrounding areas, always
with a natural result.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box col-6 content">
						<h2 class="lowercase">How long does
the treatment last?</h2>
						<p>Hyaluronic acid is a substance naturally produced by
the body, but hyaluronic acid-based fi llers are synthetic
products and are reabsorbed over months or years.
The skin has benefi ts and is revitalized by the absorption
of the dermal fi ller, but the aesthetic eff ect fades over
time.
Depending on the type and intensity of the treatment,
the results remain visible for 6-18 months, after which
the treatment can be repeated to restore natural-looking
beauty.</p>

						<h2 class="lowercase">How can I keep my skin looking young?</h2>
						<p>As we said above, the secret for skin to its full potential is to act on the extrinsic factors of aging, starting from exposure to UV rays.
Always use a high protective factor cream - this will keep your skin not only young, but also healthy for longer.
The other golden rules are:
• do not smoke: smoking impoverishes the natural production of hyaluronic acid
• do not drink alcohol: this accelerates skin aging
• nourished in a healthy way: the nutrients are needed by the skin to maintain an optimal structure
• hydrated: the skin must be “fi lled” with water!
• use gentle cleansing treatments and choose moisturising and anti-age creams that suit your skin type and day and night phases.</p>

							<h2 class="lowercase">Can I use a filler at home?</h2>
							<p>Hyaluronic acid dermal fi ller is a safe and eff ective
treatment that gives magnifi cent results without having to
resort to surgery.
However, the procedure is delicate and must be
performed in an appropriate environment. Furthermore,
the treatment must be performed by a professional who
knows the anatomy of the face, in order to guarantee a
lasting and fl awless result.</p>
